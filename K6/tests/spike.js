/*
spike test is a varation of a stress test, but it does not gradually increase the load,
 instead as spikes to extreme load over a very short window of time.
 
 Run a stress test to:
 - determine how your system will perform under a sudden surge of traffic
 - determine if your sister will recover once the traffic has subsided.
 
 Success is based on expectation. System will generally react in one of four ways.
 - Excellent: system performance is not degraded during the surge of traffic.
  Response time is similar during low traffic and high traffic
 - Good: Respond time is slower, but the system does not proceed any errors
  All request are handled.
 - Poor: system proceed errors during the surge of traffic, but recovered to normal after the traffic subsided
 - Bad: System crashes, and itâ€™s not recover after the traffic has subsided.
